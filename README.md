# Flappy Star

## About the Game

**Flappy Star** is a starry twist on the classic Flappy Bird. You guide a glowing star through a series of floating pipes in space. Along the way, you’ll see:  

- Parallax stars drifting in the background  
- Shooting stars appearing occasionally  
- A sparkling star trail that changes with velocity  
- Star shattering and particle explosion effects when hitting pipes  
- Slight screen shake on collisions for extra feedback  
- Smooth and responsive controls (tap/click or space bar)  
- A leaderboard to track high scores  

## How to Play

1. Enter your name (or leave blank to play as **Guest**)  
2. Press **Start**, tap the screen, or press **Space** to begin  
3. Keep the star afloat, avoid the pipes  
4. Earn points for each pipe you pass  
5. When you hit a pipe or fall, the star shatters and the game ends  
6. View the leaderboard to see the top scores
